Java Records are a new kind of class
that are a transparent holder for shallowly immutable data,
and they were introduced to simplify the creation of such classes,
encourage immutability, improve code readability, and ensure correctness.

Here's an example of a Record:

```
public record Point(int x, int y) { }
```

This single line of code is equivalent to the following
traditional class declaration:

```
public final class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int x() { return x; }
    public int y() { return y; }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) { /* ... */ }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() { /* ... */ }
    @Override
    public String toString() { /* ... */ }
}
```

1. **Simplicity**: Records make it easier and simpler to create classes 
that are intended to be simple data carriers.

2. **Safety**: Records are implicitly final and their fields 
are implicitly final too, which encourages immutability.

3. **Readability**: By reducing boilerplate code, 
Records make the code more readable and easier to understand.

4. **Correctness**: Records automatically provide correct implementations 
of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.
