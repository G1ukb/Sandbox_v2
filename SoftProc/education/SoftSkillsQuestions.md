* You should remember that most candidates act differently during interviews. Either because they are nervous or because they are purposely trying to deceive. Here are some questions that will help you to check the candidate’s soft skills. You can choose the most suitable for you and use them during technical interviews. But you should also understand that each candidate requires an individual approach to check soft skills. That’s why it’s not recommended to use the same questions for each candidate.
* 
* Tell me about your professional accomplishments (some specific tasks or features) you are proud of?
* Tell me about the task/ situation that was a real challenge/ tough stuff for you/ serious professional mistake over the past 6 months?
* (for seniors and leads) Imagine you have a task from the customer and several approaches/ tools/ ways to complete it (be more specific here, in accordance with the profession of the candidate). Which tool would you choose and why? Please guide me through your reasoning.
* Tell me about a situation when you had to skip/ neglect minor rules while aiming to achieve your goal (faster).
* Tell me about a task you had to complete very quickly, yet you did not have all the information you needed.
* (for senior and leads) Please describe a situation where you demonstrated your leadership.
* Please describe a situation where you had to challenge decision of your colleague, manager or more experienced member of a team.
* Tell me about a project with an aggressive timeline.
* Tell me about the most unusual or creative idea that you’ve ever come up with.
* (for mature A2 and A3-4) Suppose you were asked to lead a team…
* What would you start with? How do you think you would handle a situation, if…
* Someone disagreed with your recommendations.
* You were asked to do something for which you didn’t have proper technical skills?
* You were trying to confirm a decision and your manager wasn’t getting back to you?
* As a Lead SE you are on a project working with five other engineers. The group opinion on the proper design to proceed with divided: half the group wants to proceed one way and the other half wants to take another way. How would you handle this situation?
* 
* If you were given complete freedom of choice how would your ideal project/team look like?
* Humble, hungry, and smart concept
