Feedback:
- main instrument to develop or form 'right' behavior model
- info about how person and his behavior is perceived
- info about how one is doing in effort to reach a goal

Not:
- criticism
- judgment
- about making person not OK

Goals of feedback:
- Encourage (what to keep doing)
- Prevent (what to stop doing)
- Drive changes (what to start doing)

Rules of efficient feedback:
- Specific (based on fact)
- Non-evaluate (describe behavior)
- Well balanced (Encourage/Prevent/Changes)
- Target to the future with the possible solutions

Feedback principles: 
- give feedback in time
- Do not compare different people with each other
- Describe behavior as spesific as possible
