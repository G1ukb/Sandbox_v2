Jenkins is a hugely popular open-source tool
for continuous integration and delivery
due to its versatility and integration capabilities.

In Jenkins, all the steps of building, testing and deploying software projects
are automated, hence enhancing productivity and efficiency.

A brief overview of a typical Jenkins workflow by an example:

1. A developer commits changes to the source code in a shared repository 
(like GitHub).
2. Jenkins server constantly checks this repository for changes.
3. Upon detecting changes, Jenkins triggers a build to test and analyze the code.
4. If the code passes all tests, Jenkins deploys it to the production environment.
5. In case of any error or bug during building or testing, 
Jenkins flags it and notifies the developer.
6. The developer then rectifies the errors, 
commits the updated code to the repository, and the cycle repeats.

```groovy 
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

What problem solves: Jenkins alleviates the stress of integrating 
changes frequently and testing them. 
It ensures the software is always in a deliverable state, 
hence accelerating software development and boost productivity.

Pros:

1. Exceptional community support.
2. Wide array of plugins, enabling seamless integration with various tools.
3. Can be used across platforms.

Cons:

1. Initial setup can be complex and may require deep knowledge.
2. The user interface is not very intuitive.
3. Scaling Jenkins for larger codebases can be challenging.
