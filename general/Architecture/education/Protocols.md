* HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): This is a request-response protocol
* HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): This is a secure version of HTTP
  uses SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt the data communication.
  This includes the exchange of digital certificates
  to verify the identity of the server (and sometimes the client),
  and the negotiation of a shared secret key to encrypt the data.
* FTP (File Transfer Protocol): transferring files from
  one host to another over a TCP-based network
* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): connection-oriented protocol
* UDP (User Datagram Protocol): connectionless protocol that
  does not guarantee delivery but faster
* SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):
  This is a communication protocol for electronic mail transmission.
* IMAP / POP3 / MQTT protocols to retrieve messages from a server.
* WebSockets: full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
