<br>

Event-Driven Architecture - architecture paradigm in with an event
can be defined as the main element of the system,
it transports data and influence on the system behavior.

* Event Producers: components of the system that generate events
* Event Channels: through which the events are transported
* Event Consumers: components that react to the events

Pluses:
+ Good scalability
+ Real-Time Processing
+ Flexibility
+ Responsiveness (immediate feedback)

(In Internet of Things (IoT) systems, User Interfaces)

Minuses: 
- Complexity
- Debugging and Monitoring
- Data Consistency (Data-Intensive Systems)
