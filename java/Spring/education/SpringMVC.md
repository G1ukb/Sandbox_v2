Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a module of the Spring Framework, 
a popular open-source framework for developing Java applications. 
Spring MVC provides a structured way to design web applications 
by implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

Model: The Model represents the application data and business logic.
View: The View is responsible for rendering the model data and presenting it
(HTML, CSS)
Controller: The Controller handles user input and interactions.
(HTTP requests, business logic execution)

DispatcherServlet is a servlet that receives all the incoming HTTP requests 
and is responsible for dispatching those requests 
to the appropriate controllers.

* Request Handling: The DispatcherServlet receives all incoming requests 
and passes them to the appropriate handler methods in the controller classes.

* Controller Selection: The DispatcherServlet uses a HandlerMapping 
to determine which controller should process each request. 
The mapping can be defined explicitly by the developer, 
or it can be handled automatically by Spring MVC through component scanning.

* View Resolution: After the controller has processed the request, 
the DispatcherServlet takes the logical view name 
returned by the controller and uses a ViewResolver to map it to
a specific view object.

* Request Transformation: The DispatcherServlet transforms the results 
of the model and the view into an HTTP response that is sent back to the client.

* Exception Handling: If an exception is thrown while processing the request, 
the DispatcherServlet can handle it using a HandlerExceptionResolver 
to map the exception to a view displaying an error message.
