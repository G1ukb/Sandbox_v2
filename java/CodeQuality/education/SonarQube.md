SonarQube is an open-source platform used to measure and analyze 
the quality of source code in a software project. 

It supports many programming languages and provides reports 
on duplicate code, coding standards, unit tests, code coverage, 
complex code, potential bugs, comments, and security vulnerabilities.

Pros:
1. Extensive support for a wide range of programming languages.
2. Easy integration with build systems and other DevOps tools.
3. Provides useful and actionable metrics to maintain the quality of code.

Cons:
1. Can be tricky to configure to suit specific needs.
2. Some may find it to be resource-heavy, particularly for large codebases.
3. Could produce false positives on certain rule sets.
