Java Records are a new kind of class
that are a transparent holder for shallowly immutable data,
and they were introduced to simplify the creation of such classes,
encourage immutability, improve code readability, and ensure correctness.

Here's an example of a Record:

```
public record Point(int x, int y) { }
```

This single line of code is equivalent to the following
traditional class declaration:

```
public final class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int x() { return x; }
    public int y() { return y; }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object obj) { /* ... */ }
    @Override
    public int hashCode() { /* ... */ }
    @Override
    public String toString() { /* ... */ }
}
```

1. **Simplicity**: Records make it easier and simpler to create classes 
that are intended to be simple data carriers.

2. **Safety**: Records are implicitly final and their fields 
are implicitly final too, which encourages immutability.

3. **Readability**: By reducing boilerplate code, 
Records make the code more readable and easier to understand.

4. **Correctness**: Records automatically provide correct implementations 
of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

            Can you provide a detailed explanation of the intern
            method in Java and its usage with an example?
        </b>

<br>

The intern() method in Java is a method of the String class 
that returns a canonical representation of the string object. 

A canonical representation is a single instance of the string 
that is shared by all other strings with the same content.

When you create a string literal in Java, a new String object is created. 
However, if you use the intern() method, 
the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will check if a String object 
with the same content already exists in the string pool. 

If so, it will return the existing String object instead of creating a new one.

```
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";
String s3 = s1.intern();

System.out.println(s1 == s2); // true
System.out.println(s1 == s3); // true
```

In what situation must use: 
The intern() method should be used when you need to ensure 
that all references are to a particular string value point to the same object. 
This can be useful for performance optimization 
and for maintaining consistency and avoiding errors.
