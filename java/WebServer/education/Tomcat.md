Tomcat, is an open-source web server and servlet container 
developed by the Apache Software Foundation.

It implements several Java EE specifications including Java Servlet, 
JavaServer Pages (JSP), and WebSocket,
and provides a "pure Java" web server environment in which Java code can run.

Here are some key uses of Tomcat:
* **Serve Java Web Applications:** As a servlet container, 
it provides the components needed to run web applications 
that use Java Servlets, JSPs, and other APIs.
* **Web Server:** includes an HTTP web server and can serve static web pages written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS
* **Embedded Server:** Tomcat can be embedded into a Java application
* **Run WebSocket-based Applications:**
