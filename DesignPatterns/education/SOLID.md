Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database engine thatâ€™s
compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.

It combines the speed and reliability of high-end commercial
databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of 
open-source databases

With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five
times the throughput of
MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL
without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.

It includes a high-performance storage subsystem, 
and its MySQL- and
PostgreSQL-compatible
database engines are customized to take advantage
of that fast distributed storage
